# Contributing to this repo

ðŸŽ‰Thank you for taking time to contribute to this repo!ðŸŽ‰

**Most importantly** - please read the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

This repo is aimed to build up a collection of resources useful to folks in the academic space who want content around Microsoft technologies, especially developing using the Cloud, in this case Azure. This inculdes educators wanting content to help build curriculum, students wanting further resources to expand their knowledge, hackathon organisers and attendees who want workshops, and computer society organisers who want content for events.

Although most of this content is aimed at the higher education space, there is content for K-12 educators and students.

## What kind of content are you after?

Anything that is either platform agnostic (such as programming language content), or focuses on Azure. As long as the content is applicable to the academic audiences described above, please add it.

Although the repo is in English, the content it links to is in multiple languages. We'd love as much international content as possible.

## Where will this content live?

All the content lives in external repositories, this repo just contains a curated list of links.

## How can I add links?

Raise a PR! If you have links you would like to add, please raise a PR adding them to the [README.md](./README.md).
